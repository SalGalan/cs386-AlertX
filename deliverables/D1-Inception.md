AlertX is a inventory alert system that intends to give customers a greater opportunity at obtaining a specifed item that is, seemingly, always out of stock. Recently, a lot of markets have been dried up and left many consumers struggling to purchase their desired products; Through the use of retail API's, we can give our customers the upper-hand by alerting them as soon as their specified product comes back into stock. Notifications can be customized to be delivered via email or SMS (or both) to best suite your needs.

---------

Interviewee 1
* Who: Colin's coworker
* When: Friday, July 9
* Customer segment: Somewhat fitting; this person shops online but does purchase things that are frequently out of stock.
* Key insights from interview: Unfortunately this person has never or at least could not remember the last time they wanted an out of stock item online so badly that they would have used something similiar to this product. (They do remember not being able to find toilet paper during the first months of covid though. :-) )
* Representative quotes: (along the lines of) "I could see this being useful, but I couldn't tell you the next time I would need it."
* Assessment: Don't care

Interviewee 2
* Who: Colin's friend
* When: Sunday, July 11
* Customer segment: Very fitting; this person often shops online for items that come in and out of stock.
* Key insights from interview: One important idea that came up during this interview was the idea of missing the purchasing window. A lot of items that are in high demand will sell out quickly once they come back into stock. Even if a person checks for something every evening, that something may have come into stock and sold out again already, with the person none the wiser. This product solves that. 
* Assesment: Between must have and nice to have
